The\ndependencies usually target the NPM repository, but can target a public VCS\nrepository (e.g GitHub).

Various plugins can be included in the\nWebpack build process to perform additional changes to the source files.\nBabel\nJavaScript is a fast-changing language with many different runtimes (browsers\nand their versions). Babel allows using desired JavaScript features and syntax\nin the source code and transpiling the source code to be parseable and\nexecutable by various browsers and their versions.\nbabel-loader plugin is used (configured in webpack.config.js) to transpile\nfiles with Babel during the Webpack build process. It uses @babel/preset-env\nto target specific browsers(specified using browserlist) and also defines\nplugins that babel can use to further transform source code.\nCompare the distribution JavaScript file generated by yarn build with the\nfiles in src/.  Try running yarn build with different browser targets (i.e\nremove \"IE 10\") and see how the distribution file changes (search for class).\nBuilding on source file change\nyarn build:watch refers to the build:watch script that is defined in\npackage.json.\nThis is equivalent to running ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config\nwebpack.config.js --watch. The watch flag instructs Webpack to automatically\nrebuild the bundle whenever any source file changes. New changes are visible\nafter refreshing the web application in the browser.\nLearn more\nRefreshing whenever source files change\nyarn start refers to the start script that is defined in\npackage.json.\nThis is equivalent to running ./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --open\n--config webpack.config.js. The open flag opens the default browser on the\nspecified port (default 8080) on localhost.\nTry changing\nsrc/index.js\nand see that the browser pages refreshes automatically once you save your\nchange.\nLearn more\nSource Maps\nwebpack.config.js\ndefines devtool: \"inline-source-map\" which instructs Webpack to add a link to\nthe source code definitions to the end of app.js.  This link is call a source\nmap.\nA source map is a file which maps the transformed source (app.js) to the\noriginal source (multiple files in src.js). In the current case, a source map\nisn't an URL to a file, but a base64 encoding of the whole source definition in\nbase64. A web-browser will map the generated file (app.js) to the original\nsource. This allows both the browser to execute JavaScript that it supports and\nthe developer to debug their original, unchanged source code.\nLearn more\n"},"lecture_1/linting.html":{"url":"lecture_1/linting.html","title":"Linting JavaScript source code","keywords":"","body":"Linting example (eslint)\nLinting source code\nyarn install\nyarn lint\nExpected behaviour\nThree errors are shown:\n\nLintFail.js: Unexpected var, use let or const instead\nLintFail.js: Strings must use singlequote quotes\nLintFail.js: Unexpected console statement\n\nEach error is caused by a specific rule,\n\nUnexpected var, use let or const instead: no-var\nStrings must use singlequote: quotes\nUnexpected console statement: no-console\n\nExplanation\nyarn lint refers to the lint script that is defined in\npackage.json.\nThis is equivalent to running ./node_modules/.bin/eslint src/ from the\ncommand line.  eslint will validate that JavaScript source files pass a rules\nthat help to avoid common errors or confusing code.

The\nmotivation and guidance on how to fix it (or when to turn it off) is given for\neach rule. Some rules can even be fixed automatically by running eslint with\nthe --fix option.\nFixing linting errors\nTry to fix the problems reported by eslint.\nIf a problem reported by eslint is not valid, rules can be disabled for a specific line or file.\nWarning: You should not do this in 99% of the cases. The linter cannot help\nyou if you disable it.\nDisabling eslint for a line:\nconsole.log('Hello world'); //eslint-disable-line no-console\n\nDisabling eslint for the whole file:\n/* eslint-disable no-console */\n\nconsole.log('Hello world');\n\nNote that different comment syntaxes are used for disabling lines versus whole\nfiles. This is to avoid accidentally disabling rules for the whole file. Such\ndisable statements should be use very sparingly, otherwise the purpose of\nlinting is defeated.\nLinting continuously\nLinting is useful to get immediate feedback about mistakes and is a much faster\nalternative to catching silly mistakes than testing manually in a web browser\nand watching out for execution errors. Configure your editor to run eslint\nautomatically when the source file changes. Also add either a \"pretest\" or\n\"prebuild\" script to package.json to lint source files automatically when\nrunning yarn test or yarn build.\n"},"lecture_1/css_modules.html":{"url":"lecture_1/css_modules.html","title":"CSS and CSS modules","keywords":"","body":"CSS modules example.\nRunning the application\nyarn install\nyarn build\nopen public/index.html\nExpected behaviour\n\nA title in the center of a greenish background is seen on the page\n\nCSS\nCascading Style Sheets are used in web browsers to define how HTML is rendered\nvisually: the color and font of text, alignment of different sections etc.\nThis course will not focus on how to build maintainable CSS.\nHowever as with JavaScript files an important part of any source code is the\nability to split it into manageable chunks.  This can be achieved in CSS via\nCSS modules.\nCSS modules\nCSS modules, similarly to modules in JavaScript, cannot be resolved by the web\nbrowser runtime. The modules must be resolved by the build tool.\nThere are various ways to include CSS modules in Webpack build process. A very\nbasic example is given in this example.\nExplanation\nwebpack.config.js\nspecifies two loaders for .css files: 'style-loader' and 'css-loader'. The\nfirst ones allows import-ing a CSS file in a JavaScript file and the latter\none allows using CSS imports.

In order to have data that changes,\nstate must be used. \nMutable state is hard to understand in general. Therefore React limits the usage of state to a single Component. No other Components can read or change the state of other Components.\nState can be initialized in the class constructor\nComponents in the example\nBuild on top of the props example.\n\nApp\nhas local state now - a list of comments that grows every 5 seconds.\nCommentList\nhas been upgraded to take a list of comment objects as props.\n\n"},"lecture_2/src/pure_function_example/":{"url":"lecture_2/src/pure_function_example/","title":"Pure function components","keywords":"","body":"Pure function example\nRunning the application\nyarn install && yarn start\nOpen Pure function example subpage.\nNew dependencies\n\nReact prop types\nvalidation\n\nPure function components\nReac views use immutability to make components easier to understand and to\nimprove performance. JavaScript classes are not a good representation of an\nimmutable computation. Therefore React allows components to be defined using\nsimple functions.\nA pure function component receives props as an argument and must\nreturn a React node (JSX).\nComponents in the example\n\nApp\nhas been reverted to not increase amount of comments every 5 seconds.\nComment\nhas been implemented as a pure function component.\nCommentForm\nhas been implemented as a pure function component.\nCommentList\nhas been implemented as a pure function component.\n\nProp validation\nAll components were added prop validations. Prop validation help to catch\nerrors in data propagation early in development. They are a poor-man's version\nof typing. eslint rules \"react/prop-types\" checks that all props are\naccompanied by validation. Prop validation is removed when building a\nproduction release.\nCheck out the components or documentation for examples on how to validate\nprops.\nNote that prop validation linting was turned off for the earlier, props and\nstate examples.\n"},"lecture_2/src/user_input_example/":{"url":"lecture_2/src/user_input_example/","title":"User input","keywords":"","body":"User input example\nIntroduction to React\nRunning the application\nyarn install && yarn start\nOpen User input example subpage.\nUser input\nReact documentation on forms\nComponents in the example\n\nApp\nhas been updated to add a new comment to local state whenever a comment is\nsubmitted from CommentForm.
